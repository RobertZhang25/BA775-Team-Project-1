# BA775-Team-Project-1
This is my team's data analytics project on Spanish Wine and Customer Perceptions. Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and we performed our visualization using Tableau Public. 

Contributors of this project notebook include Sindhura Uppalapati, Anmol Srivastava, Sohil Jain, and Boyue Li. 

Objective:
Our objective is to understand the wine description metrics' influence on the item's perceived value and further provide insights on the high performing characteristics by analyzing a dataset that contains information on 7500 different types of wines.

Target End Users:
We aim our study to be helpful to distributors or resellers (those who inherit Spanish wine bottles from wineries and want to sell them) decide to take on new wine products or set their prices. Furthermore, new entrants can use this analysis to get a sense of the market before deciding on the specifications and types of wine with which they want to work.
